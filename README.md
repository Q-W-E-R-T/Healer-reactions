# Healer reactions
The project contains healer reactions for the current savage content, including a trial timeline (e5n), which can be used to get familiar with the reactions. These timeline reactions will be executend by the `general_JOB` reactions.
Additionally there can be found reactions for general end game dungeons and raids. The `general_JOB_dungeon` reaction works everywhere apart from the optimised savage raids and the trial timeline (e5n).

# Requirements
[TensorReactions](http://wiki.mmominion.com/doku.php?id=tensorreactions)

# Setup
Download the latest files and open the `TensorReactions` folder. Put reactions that contain a `general` in their name into the `GeneralTriggers` folder. The other files are timeline reactions, which have to be in the `TimelineTriggers` folder.
The next steps require you to open TensorReactions inside the MinionApp menu. Choose the correct general reaction while you're on the job you want to play. At last pick the timeline of the content you would like to enter.

# How to use
For e5n/e5s/e6s/e7s/e8s you need to load the `general_JOB` reaction and the `Healer_RAID` timeline. The `general_JOB_dungeon` is for any other dungeon than the previously mentioned.
**Examples**:
At first you would like to do e5s with your Scholar. Load the `General_SCH` reaction and the `Healer_e5s` timeline. Then you decide to do an expert roulette with your Astrologian. Just load the `General_AST_dungeon` and you are good to go.
