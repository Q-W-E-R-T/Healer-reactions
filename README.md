# Healer-reactions
The project includes healer reactions for the current savage contet, including a trial timeline (e5n), which you can use to get familar with the reactions.

# Requirements
[TensorReactions](http://wiki.mmominion.com/doku.php?id=tensorreactions)

# Setup
Download the latest files and open the TensorReactions folder. Put reactions that contain a `general` in their name into the `GeneralTriggers` folder. The other files are timeline reactions, which have to be in the `TimelineTriggers` folder.
The next steps require you to open TensorReactions inside the MinionApp menu. Choose the correct general reaction while you're on the job you want to play. At last pick the timeline of the content you would like to enter.
