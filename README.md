# Healer reactions
The project contains healer reactions for the current savage content, including a trial timeline (e5n), which can be used to get familiar with the reactions. These `Healer_RAID` timeline reactions will be executed by the `general_JOB_savage` reactions.

Additionally there can be found reactions for any other location. The `general_JOB_everywhere` reaction works anywhere apart from the optimised savage raids and the trial timeline (e5n).

# Requirements
[TensorReactions](http://wiki.mmominion.com/doku.php?id=tensorreactions)

# Setup
Download the latest files and open the `TensorReactions` folder. Put reactions that contain a `general` in their name into the `GeneralTriggers` folder. The other files are timeline reactions, which have to be in the `TimelineTriggers` folder.

The next steps require you to open TensorReactions inside the MinionApp menu. Choose the correct general reaction while you're on the job you want to play. At last pick the timeline of the content you would like to enter.

# How to use
For e5n/e5s/e6s/e7s/e8s you need to load the `general_JOB_savage` reaction and the `Healer_RAID` timeline. The `general_JOB_everywhere` is for any other dungeon than the previously mentioned. In conclusion the `general_JOB_savage` only works with content that has a timeline. For everything else switch to the `general_JOB_everywhere` profile.

**Examples**:
At first you would like to do e5n (e5s) with your Scholar. Load the `General_SCH_savage` reaction and the `Healer_e5n` (`Healer_e5s`) timeline. Then you decide to do an expert roulette with your Astrologian. Just load the `General_AST_everywhere` and you are good to go. At last you would like to do e6n, which also needs the `general_JOB_everywhere` profile.
