# How to setup:
Download the latest files. Put reactions that contain a 'general' in their name into the 'MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\TensorReactions\GeneralTriggers' folder. The other files are timeline reactions, which have to be in the 'TimelineTriggers' folder.
The next steps require you to open TensorReactions inside the MinionApp menu. Choose the correct general reaction while you're on the job you want to play. At last pick the timeline of the content you would like to enter.
